## Purpose
The current goal of this repository (this will be updated) is to preview two datasets and select one after weighing both options
and clean that dataframe then selecting one and cleaning it to prepare it for analysis starting with a correlation heat map and some visualizations followed by various optimized models to find the highest number of people to advertise a new pool cleaning and construction company.
